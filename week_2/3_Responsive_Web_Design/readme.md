# U1.W2: Responsive Web Design 

## Learning Competencies
- Describe responsive design
- Determine whether responsive design is good or bad practice


## Summary

We think of the web and websites as mostly static. They look the way
they look.  But it's really more complicated than that.  Browsers and
operating systems make things look different. Then, smart phones arrived
and made everything crazy.  Web designers and developers spend a lot of
time thinking about how to make web pages usable in all the possible
formats (phones, tablets, web) while keeping them maintainable (i.e. not
taking a billion years to make small changes). Responsive design is one
of the ways developers have created to make sites usable, maintable, and
adaptable to new devices and browsers. 

**Everything in this challenge is within the context of the `unit1_projects` folder in your website repository.**

## Release 0: Research

Look into responsive web design.  What is it? Why is it used?
*You do not need to go through all these resources.  We'd recommend either going through the first two (slide intro, read beginners) OR the Treehouse tutorial.*

- Slides: [Introduction to Responsive Web Design and Compatability](http://girldevelopit.github.io/gdi-core-intermediate-html-css/class4.html#/1)
- Read: [Beginners guide to responsive web design](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/beginners-guide-to-responsive-web-design)
OR
- Make: [Treehouse: Build a Responsive Website](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-responsive-website)

Additional required resources:
- Slides: [Web Accessibility](http://girldevelopit.github.io/girldevelopit-rdu-access/classslides.html#/)
- Read: [Change your browsers user agent](http://osxdaily.com/2013/01/16/change-user-agent-chrome-safari-firefox/)


## Release 1: Apply

Using either a new html page in the `unit1_projects` folder or [practice files](http://girldevelopit.github.io/gdi-core-intermediate-html-css/class4.zip) unzipped into the `unit1_projects` folder, try to make your page more responsive. 

How does it look when
- on your phone 
- on a tablet
- on really wide screen
- resized really small
- the user agent is changed in your browser

You can try using [QuirkTools](http://quirktools.com/screenfly) to see a site in multiple browsers.

## Release 2: Reflect
Reflect on your learning by answering the questions in the [reflection](my_reflection.md) file.

## Release 3: Commit and sync/push your changes!
Make sure you can see all of your changes on your github.io site!
