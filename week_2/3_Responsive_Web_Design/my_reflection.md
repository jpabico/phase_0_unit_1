# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

responsive web design is web design that is made to optimize viewing depending on the browser being used whether it is chrome, firefox, or a browswer on a tablet or phone. I think it is very useful, and a good practice, but a bit confusing.
I think smartphones and tablets have changed web design through requiring innovation in web design so that users can have a similar experience through different means. I think that future technology will either add more ways to view web pages and simplify experiences on the user end.
visually impaired people most likely use web pages through voice over technology. I have also heard that their are special braille computers that are able to allow the users to read the web pages through braille and change accordingly. I think design for the visually impaired will be a big challenge, but is also a great opportunity for innovation.
My favorite part of this section was learning that I could add links to ids by simply putting an <a ref> link to the id of a particular div.
