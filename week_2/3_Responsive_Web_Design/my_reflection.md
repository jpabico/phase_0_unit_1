# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* I think responsive web design is brilliant. It seems really illogical to maintain sites for different deivces (as there are so many these days) as well as the fact that people like to resize sites as the wish, without ruining the integrity of the page. 
* Smaller devices have forced pretty much all sites to move to this method, as a 'mobile' site doesn't cut it anymore. People are using tablets as their main devices and you therefore want to ensure they have the expeience of a full website. I think sites will only get more responsive as time goes on.
* I would imagine there are browser settings along with auditory tools to help with this. We should develop to ensure they can have an equally as enjoyable browsing experience.
* Mobile sites, ie targeted sites that are stripped out don't really seem like a wise decision anymore. Most browsing devices are advanced enough to have a bit of an upgrade on these sites.
