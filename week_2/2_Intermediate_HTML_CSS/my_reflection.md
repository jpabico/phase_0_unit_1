# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
* 

* I really like the new web standards, its always funny being new with something as the old style just seems so illogical. I think they make things a lot easier, which is proven by the div-aster example used in the GDI slides.
* It makes sense and is pretty logical, so I am a fan. It allows you to label things accordingly without the requirement of a ton of divs which is nice.
* Similar to above, I think it makes sense.
* reset.css is necessary as there are so many different browsers with different default settings, and adjusting your code accordingly would simply take too much time. By having this, you're essentially creating a blank slate to apply your style to.
* I have used chrome, firefox, ie, and safari. Very rarely do I see a difference these days but I do remember sometimes seeing one with old IE at work. It would be nice if they all appeared the same. 
* I used a little W3 schools for hover and for @font.
