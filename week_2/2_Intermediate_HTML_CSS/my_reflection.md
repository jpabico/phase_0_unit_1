# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Web standards are very helpful for many newbies to html and css it gives them a background to work with. personally, I like the standardized structure because it makes everything more easy to read and organize. I think that the header footer and nav elements are nice additions, but not exactly necessary. The importance of reset.css is to minimize unaccounted for variables in things such as margin width or height. In my past I have used Internet explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. The biggest differences in page rendering occured between IE and any other browser.
