          <p>Pair programming is important because it serves as a fail safe. If someone makes a mistake, 
          the other person can catch it. You also learn more by teaching each other.</p>
          <p>So what is pairing? Pairing is working together with someone else, ideally at an equal level or expert/novice level. 
          In the latter arrangement, it is beneficial for the expert to drive so the novice gets to explain his or her thoughts.</p>
          <p>The driver is the one who is typing out the code. The navigator directs it. </p>
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>Jesson:This pairing session went more smoothly than I had expected it would. 
            The assignment was not too difficult and it was a good experience.
            Stypi was a bit frustrating because it wouldn't style some of our css. Cassidy 
            was very easy to work with and we worked well together as both navigators and drivers.
          </p>
          <p>Cassidy: First pair session felt good! I am not used to collaborating in such a structured manner, but after trying it, I realize that 
              it is very helpful for getting two people that don't know each other off the ground and producing work together smoothly, quickly and
              happily. The collaboration and facilitation by Emily worked very well. There were only a couple times that I think Jesson and I had
              different ideas, and we were able to articulate both ideas and choose a path forward very easily. Stypi did not work well because we
              could not see our updates.
