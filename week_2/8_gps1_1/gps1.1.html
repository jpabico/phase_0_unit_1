    <h1>Peer programming 101</h1>
    <p>The program is 9 weeks of intensive training in professional web development, including Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.[6][7][8] The program takes students with little or no prior programming experience and teaches them the fundamentals of computer programming.[9][10] The program's goal is to develop the necessary skills within the students to make them job-ready for an entry-level developer position.[9] Applicants have varied backgrounds, ranging from students who have master's degrees in computer science to Starbucks baristas.[9]

The program values learning by building and doing; in contrast to traditional classrooms, Dev Bootcamp students work through a series of programming challenges, usually working in pairs or small groups, which culminates in a final group project.[11][12][13] The tuition costs are $12,200 for the 9 week, 40 hour per week program. Core class hours are weekdays 9am-6pm in San Francisco and 8am-5pm in Chicago. However, most students stay nights and weekends, which amounts to an approximate 70-80 hours per week.[9] Dev Bootcamp organizes hiring days for technology companies to interview students.[9] They then collect a referral fee from employers that hire their graduates, and they pass along part of that fee to the graduate in the form of a hiring bonus.[9]</p>
