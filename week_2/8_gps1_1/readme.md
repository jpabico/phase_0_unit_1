#U1.W2: GPS 1.1: Your First Pairing Session! 

**DO NOT LOOK AT THIS CHALLENGE UNTIL YOUR FIRST GUIDED PAIRING SESSION!!**

#### Learning Competencies
  - Use HTML tags to place content on a website
  - Apply CSS to position elements on an HTML page
  - Compare different HTML tags to one another
  - Examine pair-programming concepts

#### Summary
  Welcome to your first Guided Pairing Session (GPS!)
  We are excited to have you in Phase 0 and to work with
  you to get you prepared for an exciting time at DBC. 

  This GPS is designed to help you examine pair programming and the roles of driver and 
  navigator. 
  
  **Since this is your first pairing session, it is important
  to have a good check-in (so don't forget!).**

## GPS-Specific Instructions
  - After you finish this exercise, copy and paste your collaborative code
    into a local HTML and CSS document and push this new page up to your
    github.io website to publish it online - and link to it from the index of your site...Also add the code to the phase_0_unit_1 repo in the pre-made files. .
  - You will be directed to Stypi.com, where your instructor
     will have a stypi file ready for you. Because we cannot actually link 
     a stylesheet to an HTML page in stypi, we will be placing CSS 
     between the `<style>` tags. It will be your job to put the correct 
     material in the correct file after the session. 
     **This is not good practice, we are only doing it so you can preview your page using stypi.**
  - Now you are ready to begin! Your goal is to design a website that
     introduces the concept of pair programming!  (You get to figure out how to 
     present it on the page) 

## Release 0: Wireframe the site
Discuss how you want the page to look. Draw a wireframe or use a wireframing tool with your pair. It doesn't have to be perfect, but get a rough idea of how you want the site to look

## Release 1: Start with HTML
Include: a title and your names on your site. Style it based on your wireframe. 

## Release 2: Discuss Pair Programming
Together, discuss and describe why you think pair-programming is important to DBC.
Code up what you've discussed according to the wireframe you made. Also discuss what pairing means and define driver and navigator. You will want to compare these on the website.

## Release 3: Dress it up! 
Use CSS to make it look nice. Include pictures, outside fonts, etc. 

## Release 4: Reflect with your pair. 
What was it like to pair for the first time? Did you enjoy it? What worked? What didn't work? Add your reflection to your page and style it as well. 

## Release 5: Copy, commit, and sync
When you are finished, copy your code into the [gps1.1.css](gps1.1.css) and [gps1.1.html](gps1.1.html) files. Make sure your css from the `<style>` section is in the CSS file and remove it from the HTML section. Update the html file. Then, test that everything is still  working by saving them 
and running them together from your computer. 

Commit and sync/push your changes onto the phase_0_unit_1 repository. 

## Release 6: Give Feedback
Don't forget to give [feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback/new) to your pair!
