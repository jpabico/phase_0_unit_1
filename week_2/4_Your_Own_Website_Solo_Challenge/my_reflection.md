# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- eshem.github.io -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* I learned a lot about UX especially in terms of how big of an impact planning experience is on user retention and ease of use. I now see why UX is such a large topic. Design and UX are very closely intertwined, while being an expert in 1 doesn't necessarily make you an expert in the other. Good developers need to have skills in both to plan nice, easy to use apps. 
* I like UX, while design isn't exactly my favorite. I don't mind it, but thinking through how someone uses a site is more exciting to me than planning how it actually looks. 
* I looked at some sites I liked and planned my wireframe from there. This allowed me to get some inspiration and then develop my own idea.
* The site still looks pretty bad in terms of CSS, so I'd like to potentially add some margin, border, and padding to make it look a bit better.
* I didn't find it very difficult, however I did use a lot of W3 to remind myself of certain things in terms of CSS.
