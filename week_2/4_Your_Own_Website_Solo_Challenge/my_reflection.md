# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: jessonfoo.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned that design and user experience is a lot harder than I thought it would be. It was hard to work on my site because when I first set it up, I made it overly complicated and unorganized. I think that I need to work on the wireframing more and continue to improve on it. I liked my layout, so my process was to try and add some organization to what I already had and try to make changes that would make it easier to read. As I continue to change my site I want to add more content, I just don't really know what to add as of yet. I found it a little bit hard to apply what I learned without completely redesigning my page, although I am open to that option.
