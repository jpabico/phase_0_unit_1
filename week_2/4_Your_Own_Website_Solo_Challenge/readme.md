# U1.W2: Your website (Solo Challenge)


## Learning Competencies
- Illustrate your understanding of web design and user experience in your website
- Describe and practice process of building a website


## Summary

**THIS IS YOUR SOLO CHALLENGE FOR WEEK 2.** Please reference the [Phase 0 Handbook](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/) for more details as to what this entails. 

Regardless of whether design is interesting to you or not, web design matters to end users of the website and business management.  It's important to know about so you can work more effectively with other teams in the organization.  This process should also help you learn to separate different parts of a site (design vs. content, html vs. css, user interface vs. user experience) and learn the process of developing websites.


## Release 0: Delve into Design
 
We're going to make your [USERNAME].github.io website truly yours.  This challenge is a chance for you to customize and make the site reflect you.  You will work on the `index.html` page through this challenge.

You've already read about Design Thinking and Wireframing.  Let's go a bit deeper.

Delve into a few of the following resources.  Try to look at at least
one in each section. *You don't need to go crazy* if you don't have the time or interest.  Get an overview then get creative and put it into practice. You can also read more later.

## Release 1: Review Wireframing

#### Refreshers
You should have already read the below, but here are the links if you
want to review.

- Read: [A Beginners Guide to Wireframing](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-wireframing--webdesign-7399)
- Read: [Beyond Wireframing: Real Life UX Design Process](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/29/beyond-wireframing-real-life-ux-design-process/)

## Release 2: Wireframe your Site
Create a `my_wireframe.html` file in your `unit1_projects` folder (This folder is in your [USERNAME]github.io repository NOT the `phase_0_unit_1` repository).

- Create a plan for your new web page and put the plan into your html
file.  Add, commit, and push a file with the details to Github.
- Create a wireframe of your website.  You can use pen and paper or a wireframing tool.  
- Take a screenshot, photo, or save the file. Upload the file to an
image sharing service.
- Add the image to your html file.  Commit and push the file to Github. 

## Release 3: Code it up

Use the plan and wireframe as a guide to make the [USERNAME].github.io
`index.html` and corresponding css files reflect your current skills. Make sure you commit
and push all your html changes to Github.  

*Remember: you can open an html file in a browser to see changes as you
go*

Get creative. Have fun.  But be conscious of time.  This will be a work in progress.

## Release 4: Reflect
Go write your [reflection](my_reflection.md) and answer the questions!

## Release 5: Commit and sync/push your changes!
Make sure you can see all of your changes on your github.io site!
