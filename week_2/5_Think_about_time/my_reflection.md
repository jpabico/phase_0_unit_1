# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

I thought that this section was super helpful for me because I was stressing out a lot these past two days trying to catch up on what I had fallen behind on. My biggest time management challenge was that the plans I had made for studying did not include the possibility of me getting sick or any other complications. I will try to combat these challenges by trying to start small. I often get intimidated by tasks because I tend to look at projects as one big task. I will try out the pomodoro technique and the minimal viable product concept. My plan for Phase 0 will be to get things done, and then tweak when I have a better understanding.
