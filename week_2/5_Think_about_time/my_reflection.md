# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
* 

* I think the biggest challenge for me is balancing prep with my current job. While I am very dedicated to my prep work, its a balance of finding the time after work and getting used to having another actiivity to worry about and focus. After starting at a computer all day, its a challenge to do the prep work. 
* I combat it by seeing the value in the prep work and actually enjoying what I am working on it, which is not always the case in my other obligations. 
* I am going to try the pomodoro technique as I believe it has a good balance of being hyperfocused and having a break. This allows you to revitalize and take action again. I really do think this is going to help.
* My overall plan is to dedicate at least an hour a day to the work, along with a few days of several hours. This keeps me engaged with my prep and also ensures that I don't leave it all until the last minute. I think this will help me in getting used to doing homework again, helpful for the prep and the upcoming course.
