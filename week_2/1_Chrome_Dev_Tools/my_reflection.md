# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

the document object model is a tree like structure or compilation of html on a web page. Its very useful in the sense that it makes navigating through an html page easy when going through complex html. Looking at the wordpress site using chrome dev tools was somewhat confusing for me because the head section contained a lot of meta tags that I was unfamiliar with, but it was also interesting to try and see what they did. In comparison, my site was much more simple, but did not have a very organized DOM layout. Overall, I thought Chrome Web Tools to be very helpful in understanding a web page's elements.
