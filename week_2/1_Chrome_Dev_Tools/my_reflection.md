# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
* 

* DOM allows you to make real time changes to webpages via your browser. It is also very useful in debugging and increasing optimization, which would be far more complicated without DOM. It makes sense as one should have a way to dynamically update pages and debug in real time. I didn't realize you could do this for sites that were not yours, which is really cool.
* Wordpress was far more complicated probably due to all of the scripts. There were a bunch of meta tags as well. However, I don't think that it really disables the use of web tools.
* Editing inreal time was really nice and an aha moment, as I have been thinking about something that would allow you to do that.
