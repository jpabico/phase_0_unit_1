* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?
command+option+i

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)
      background-color: #0b0f11
  * Tweak the background color to white.

  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.

  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/

  * Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.
  
  Because it is an image.

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website? 

  * Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.
    the largest image is: "http://www.ticketswizard.com/Images/Catalog/92624182-c482-4a35-8da2-4fbf2f502e94_Large_Large.png" [316kb]
    to find it, I went to the network tab on developer tools and sorted by size.

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?
