# U1.W1: Your Favorite Websites


## Learning Competencies
- Evaluate a website in terms of design and user experience
- Compare websites to one another to discuss the pros and cons of their approaches

## Summary
In the same way that professors and graduate students are required to contribute through publications, developers are expected to make contributions to their field through blog posts, stackoverflow and other site answers, and giving talks. In Phase 0, you will start your contributions through blogging about cultural and technical topics that correspond to the week's topics. 

## Release 0: Your favorite websites

Identify three of your favorite websites. 


## Release 1: Consider the Design

Ask yourself:
  * Why is this one of your favorite sites?
  * What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?
  * How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "pretty", "elegant", "simple", "dark", "cluttered", "basic" etc)
  * What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?  
  * What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "fun", "whimsical", "silly", "serious" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?
  * How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?
  * How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?
  * How do you feel after being on the site for a while? (i.e. "bored", "happy", "anxious or hyper", "like I wasted a lot of time" etc)
  * Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?


## Release 2: Create your directory and file. 

In your [USERNAME].github.io site, create a new directory called 'blog-posts'. You will put your template, and all of your blog posts in this directory. 
Then, create a new HTML file in your [USERNAME].github.io website. Using the HTML skills you learned this week, create a blog template. What makes up a good blog form? 

Then create a stylesheet.css sheet and link to it from the HTML file. Apply some CSS to your template to make it pretty. 

Copy the code from your blog template to a new HTML file called `week1_technical.html` in the `blog-posts` folder. 

## Release 3: Blog it!

Write a blog post analyzing the 3 sites in terms of user experience and design. Link to your post from `index.html` so people can navigate to your page from your site's index. 
Don't forget to sync/push your changes to make them live on your github.io site!

## Release 4: Reflect
On your local `phase_0_unit_1` repo, edit the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge. Commit your changes and save them to GitHub.
