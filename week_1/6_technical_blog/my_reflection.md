Blog url: <!-- Blog URL here (remove comment)  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

* I really enjoyed working on this as I was able to think about and analyze websites I visit on a daily basis. Getting a grasp of the layout is simply while analyzing design and ease of use is a bit harder to analyze. This was very helpful in that sense.
