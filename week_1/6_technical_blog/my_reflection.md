Blog url: http://jessonfoo.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_techincal_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

Although I can say I did enjoy reasearching material for my blog post, writing it took a while. For me, writing always takes a good amount of time because there are so many ways to write a single sentence. However, I really enjoyed reflecting on what my three favorite websites were because I had never really thought about it. Iinitally I was going to write about google, facebook, and youtube. Eventually, I realized that those three were in no way my favorite websites, but rather the websites I happened to use the most. All in all, I found this exercise relaxing because I felt less stressed about the css and html.
