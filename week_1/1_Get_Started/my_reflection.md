## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

* I found the setup of git and github relatively easy. Didn't really run in to any sort of errors in the setup, it moreso took a bit of time to understand forking and why it would be useful. I learned that forking could be useful when using a public file (similar to this one) and that if I was ever cool enough to have a massive impact, I could send a pull request.
* Git is track changes for computer programming. Its value lies in the fact that you can save changes to code as opposed to saving over an existing file. The value is twofold; it is helpful when collaborating with others so that you can work in real time, as well as the fact that you can easily reverse potentially heartbreaking mistakes. Github exploits the value of git in that you can host these files or tracked changes on the internet. This gives you constant access to your app, as well as public or semi-private exposure so that it can easily be shared. When collaborating it is valuable for sharing and working seamlessly while individuals value an online backup.
* Version control allows you to save the changes that you (or a colleague) have made to a file. This is like a constant backup of your work and a way to see how a file has changed over time. If you know that something is failing after a certain point, you can go back and see what change was made to potentially cause that. Github very nicely highlights what has been changed and what it has been changed to. This is very valuable as without it, you could potentially have to search through thousands of lines of code. What I mentioned above with regards to sharing and a remote backup also apply here. 
* As mentioned in the prior point, when using thousands of lines of code, tracking changes is extremely valuable. One typo or removed letter can break an app with many lines of code. Therefore, having a backup and a constant set of backups (if you commit) is very helpful. Having this remotely also allows you to track the changes others have made to a collaborative project. This makes perfect sense as it saves a lot of time and headache when trying to diagnose an error.
* This all makes sense and is very logical considering how complex code becomes and the nature of sharing and working with others.
