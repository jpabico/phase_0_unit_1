Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

Hey everyone, 

I am Eric and I live in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which is really fun. My favorite websites are twitter.com, youtube.com, and medium.com. My thinking style was a tie between Abstract Sequential and Concrete Random. My Vark style is Kinesthetic. 

I like to eat a lot. I also like to run a lot. Some say I have a problem. 

My main blog is at eshem.github.io and my repo is at https://github.com/eshem/phase_0_unit_1, I am still working on making it look a lot better. My wireframes are at eshem.github.io/wireframe_sites.html.

Looking forward to meeting you guys soon.

Best,

Eric

* I mostly enjoyed viewing other people's sites. I noticed that many have the same fears about DBC, which is fair and comforting.
