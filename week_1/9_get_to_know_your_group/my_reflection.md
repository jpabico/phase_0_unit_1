Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

Reading other people's responses to their fears about DBC from the cultural blogs was soothing. It was nice to know that I wasn't the only one who initially came in expecting a restaurant style experience. It was also nice listening to positive excitement towards the future. The vibes I got from their excitement gave me more positive feelings towards DBC as well. Also reading about how they felt gave me a sense of closeness, and made it feel more like we were in it together. Altogether, this week has been hectic for me because I underestimated the workload. I expected to work 15-20 hours but ended up spending closer to 30 hours.
