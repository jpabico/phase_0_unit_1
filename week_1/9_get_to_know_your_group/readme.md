# U1.W1: Get to know your group


## Learning Competencies
- Introduce yourself to your accountability group
- Describe what you learned from someone else's reflections
- Consider strategies for time management and productivity
- Design a plan for getting work done during Phase 0

## Summary

Despite popular belief, most software engineers work in teams and there is a strong developer community (on the web and locally) for many technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby.  It's important to get used to sharing with each other.


## Release 0: Intro Email

Once you know who is in your accountability group, send everyone in your group and email **and** edit the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge in your local `phase_0_unit_1` repo,. Commit your changes and save them to GitHub. 

* Name
* Location
* Favorite websites
* Gregorc Thinking Style (Abstract Random, Abstract Sequential, Concrete Random, Concrete Sequential)
* Learning style (Visual, Aural, Kinesthetic, Multimodal)

## Release 1: Share your work
**DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOU HAVE ISSUES ENABLED AS A FEATURE ON BOTH OF YOUR REPOSITORIES**

Once you've completed the week's work, send them:
* link to your forked `phase_0_unit_1` repository
* link to your [USERNAME].github.io site
* link to your wireframe html page

Once you receive someone's repository link, take a moment to review your accountability member's reflections in their various challenges. Then leave feedback for them using the instructions on ["How to Create an Issue"](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/review.md).
