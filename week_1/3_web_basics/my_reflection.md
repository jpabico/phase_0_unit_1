* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?

* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned that the "web" is literally similar to a spiderweb in the sense that when you view a webpage or establish any connectiont through the internet you are connecting to another computer or a server. Internet connections such as webpages connect to ip addresses hidden behind a domain name using a domain name server DNS. Two important things to remember when setting up your HTML site is to remember to use tags and to close every tag that you open. When I saw my web page live it was very exciting, I felt a sense of accomplishment. Additionally, setting up git to connect to GitHub through the terminal this time was helpful in furthering my understanding of git and helped with reviewing the commands.
