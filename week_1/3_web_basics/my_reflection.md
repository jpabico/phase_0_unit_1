* I learned the difference between the web and the internet itself. While I did know that the internet has existed far longer for the web, I always referred to the two interchangeably. 
* You need an index page so that viewers can see something! But more importantly, following the steps of creating the page and backing up to Git and pushing to GitHub so that you can view it live.
* It felt really cool to see the page live. I didn't realize that I would be able to view it via a direct link as opposed to some crazy link through GitHub. Really cool!
* I think there was an aha moment when I actually used the GitHub app to publish and then use my browser to view it.
* No other resources
