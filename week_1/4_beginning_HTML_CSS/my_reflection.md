* I think HTML is pretty logical. I found some of the codes to be a little odd and hard to remember but I do like that you need to remember to close each code. Links were the most challenging as they seem to be the least logical.
* It allows for a ton of control which is really nice, but if you have a big site it could take ages to build and design all of it out. 
* The site actually working (or failing to work at times) allowed me to validate my work which was really nice.
* I used a bit of google to try and remembers some of the tags.
