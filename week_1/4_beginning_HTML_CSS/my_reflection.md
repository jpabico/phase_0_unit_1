* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


The thing that I liked best about HTML is how it is very structured and organized. I like that CSS can be both inlaid and external. The thing I like least is that new lines are not necessary. I think it is both a good and band thing. While it is one less error to worry about, the freedom it gives is an opportunity to write cluttered HTML.
When I first encountered HTML, the idea of having to rewrite every element with a "/" in front of it seemed so tedious. However, as I thought about it more I realized this happens in ruby as well as python and java script when we type end.
