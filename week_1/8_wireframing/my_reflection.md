## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I learned that user experience plays a large role in the success of a website. I do enjoy working on design and user experience because I enjoy tinkering and improving on my designs. Wireframing was both fun and not for me. Because I decided to create general layouts of the websites I chose before I had completed the readings, I ended up doing more work than I needed to. If I had read the articles first, I would have realized that there were tools online that would have made the process much easier.
Topics that I was thinking about when working on this section were how to collect observations without conducting surveys or beta groups. My confidence in the Learning Competencies for this challenge are about equal to the rest of the sections. I don't know exactly all the functions of html and css, but it seems relatively easy to search for an answer to the questions I have regarding the topic. The parts of this weeks challenge that I enjoyed most was tinkering with my website. The most tedious part was finding websites to write about, and trying to describe them accordingly.
