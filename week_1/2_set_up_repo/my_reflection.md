## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Creating a repository on GitHub is like adding a folder in your email inbox, it's quite straight forward, you click on your username, then a button labeled "repositories," followed by the "[+ new]" button. Give your repository a title, description, and choose your OSS license type. Open Source Software means that your program's source code is available for other developers to use, copy, study or change. Personally, I like the idea of OSS, I think it's a great way to get your software into the public and get feedback. OSS licenses can be quite important depending on the author of the license and the type, certain licenses such as a "Creative Commons" license ensure that at the very least your name will be attributed to all subsequent and derivative works. On the other hand choosing an MIT license is like putting a sign up that says "free stuff do whatever you want with it." This challenge helped me to understand the difference between OSS and closed source programs such as Microsoft office or Photoshop. I realized how common OSS is, and that I've already used a few before such as open office. The difference between source and binaries distribution was a confusing topic for me. I found out the difference by looking it up on "www.gnu.org/software/kawa/Binary-distribution.html" from what I read it sounds like binary distribution is a release of the compiled program but in binary.
