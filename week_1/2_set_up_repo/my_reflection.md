## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* To create a repo on Github, you just need to click on the the + sign in the top bar and go to Create > New Repository. From there, you would provide a name for the repo as well as decide if you'd like it to be shared publicly or only allow it for your use. You'll then be prompted for a license, of which there are several choices. I recommend using the MIT License, which is the most simple and allows your software to freely be used and potentially distributed.
* Open source essentially states that your software, depending on the specific open source license used, can essentially be copied, modified, distributed, and more. The modifier must follow the rules of the license that you provide with your software, and also provide that same license in distribution. 
* I think open source is great as it engages a community around your software. If you gain a following, you are incorporating the work of others, potentially globally, to increase the quality of the product. In the case that you'd like to make money or only allow others a certain level of freedom, that is possible as well. In a world where software is slowly moving away from closed source, the avenues for profit can be found elsewhere, while exploiting the value of open source. It doesn't make me nervous, by sharing your work with others it allows for greater collaboration and ultimately a better product.
* It is important to use a license as it sets the tone for your software moving forward. For example, if your repo is available publicly on GitHub and someone finds it, they need to know what kind of liberty they can have with your source code in potentially modifying and distributing it. There are many license types that accomodate specific needs and therefore it shouldn't be too complicated to decide on which to add to your project.
* I definitely have a better understanding of open source. I have always been familiar with the Mozilla Foundation, but it now all makes more sense.
* The only other resource I used, was briefly looking through http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_and_closed_source
