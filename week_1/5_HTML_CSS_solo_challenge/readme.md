## Learning Competencies

Think about something you want to teach people about. You will be building a webpage about that topic, so everything in this challenge should be used to teach others about that. You can go above and beyond, adding pictures, fonts, etc. At least create a page that meets the HTML and CSS requirements described in releases 0 and 1.
