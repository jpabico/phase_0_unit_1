* I mostly asked questions on CSS and linking as well as the different between using #'s div's and classes. Re-reading helped a lot as did, some W3C documentation. It is much more clear now. 
* Definitely CSS again, I found it to be more complex than HTML but have hashed out my issues. 
* Yes! I feel way more confident and don't feel that I need to rely on the resources.
* As above, I feel way more omfortable now and working through it on my own was great.
* I enjoyed the freedom to use my creativity as opposed to having very specific instructions.
* I didn't really find any of it tedious.
