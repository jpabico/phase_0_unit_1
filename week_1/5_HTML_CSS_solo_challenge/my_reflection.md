This chalenge, I decided to push myself to try and imitate the design of another website. The challenge was adding the a side bar that would float over everything. since I already had a very specific image of what i wanted my site to look like, I had to set the height and width of my side bar to a specific size so that it would float and not get in the way of what I wanted it to look like. When I was writing the css for this I was asking myself what is a side bar really? can a side bar be a bar that floats a long the middle of a page? does it have to be on the "side?" I learned lots of new skills/tricks from working on this challenge. I enjoyed being able to set up the way my website looked. It was also this unrestraint that may have led me to spend more time on tinkering with the page than I shold have. the most tedious parts were making the side bar and footer for me because I chose to make them invisible, but still in compliance with the directions. I had checked with a different colored background first to make sure I was doing it properly.
