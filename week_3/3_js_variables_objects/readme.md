# U1.W3: JavaScript Variables and Object Types

## Learning Competencies
- Define local variables in JavaScript
- Create objects of different types in JavaScript
- Create and add objects to an array in JavaScript
- Use pre-written tests to drive development

## Summary
Now that you have had a bit of fun with JavaScript in the [Code Combat](../2_code_combat) 
challenge, you will want to learn a bit more about how JavaScript works. Before working 
on this challenge, read through [object_types](../reading_material/object_types.md) and 
[JavaScript Intro](../reading_material/javascript_intro_lab). Make sure to practice as 
you go. You can open a new sublime file and run it in your terminal with node.js. 
This will help to solidify your knowledge. By the way, this would be a cool thing to pair on. 
If you read with your pair and practice as you go, you may learn the concepts a bit better.  

In this challenge you will be creating a series of variables. The values of the variables 
will be different types of JavaScript objects.

## Release 0: Test-Driven Development

You will find test code at the bottom of your [my_solutions.js](my_solutions.js) file. Run the code in this file either from the command line 
using Node.js or by pasting the code of this entire file into your browser console. All tests will log `true` in the console when they pass--`false`, otherwise.

The tests will tell you what to do next.  Run the code and read the message explaining 
why the code couldn't run or why the test failed.  The first step is going be to make 
the first test pass.  Then make the second test pass, and so on.

Hint: If you get an error message that says something like ...

`ReferenceError: secretNumber is not defined`, try declaring a variable with that name (e.g., `secretNumber`).

This is your first introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD). In this challenge, you will be dependent upon the provided driver code to guide your coding. Read [The Newbie's Guide to Test-Driven Development](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-newbies-guide-to-test-driven-development--net-13835) to learn more about TDD if you're interested. 

## Release 1: Commit and push
Now that you've done all this work, don't forget to push your changes to github using the command line!

Make sure to edit line 1 to reflect whether you worked on the challenge on your own or with a pair. If you worked with a pair, make sure to put his/her name!

## Release 2: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/reflection_guidelines.md)
In the reflection section of your 'my_solution.js` file, reflect on your learning using the [reflection guidelines](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/reflection_guidelines.md). ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!***

## Release 3: [Review others' Reflections/Solutions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/review.md)

Leave an issue telling the student what they did well and can do better next time with regard to the pseudocode and reflection. Be kind, specific and actionable. (You are expected to leave at least two comments for this challenge).
