// Reflection: Use the reflection guidelines to write a reflection here. 
// 
// What we found worked for us was a sort of trial and error method. 
// We would type out a line of code and run the file to see if it would be fixed.
// One of the problems we faced was not knowing what we were supposed to do. Once we
// got the ball rolling, we figured things out pretty quickly. Two questions we had when
// working on this challenge was what assert was, and what throw was. At this point, there
// are no real concepts we struggled with, but we learned about how the assert function works.
// A trick that we learned was how to deal with errors in JS. I feel fairly confident with all 
// four competencies. I enjoyed trying solve the errors in the challenge because it was like
// solving a puzzle.
