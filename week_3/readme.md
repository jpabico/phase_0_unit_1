# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is known as the "language of the web." It is a powerful object-oriented language (Ruby is as well). It is light-weight and can communicate with the browser. This week, we will introduce you to basic JavaScript syntax. The goal is not to teach you JavaScript, rather, we want you to feel comfortable with simple variables and functions. 

You will not begin using JavaScript until Phase 2 in Dev Bootcamp, but don't worry if you feel like you will forget everything. You will have the chance to review in the last two weeks of Phase 0 and the weekend before you begin Phase 2. Moreover, professional programmers look up information and syntax all the time. They don't have everything memorized either, so think of this as an introduction. The more you use JavaScript the more you will remember. For our purposes here, we want you to learn basics so that you can easily re-learn them later. 

**You have an aesynchronous group challenge this week. Take a look at it early so you don't get blind-sided.**

## Before you begin:
- [Install Node.js](reading_material/install_node.md)
- Read about [JavaScript 'Object' Objects](http://www.sitepoint.com/back-to-basics-javascript-object-syntax/) Understanding this well will be very beneficial.
- You may choose to read through [JavaScript Reading Material](reading_material) before starting the challenges.

## Challenges
1. ["Git" Started](1_git_started)
2. [Code Combat](2_code_combat)
3. [Javascript Variables and Objects](3_js_variables_objects)
4. [Manipulating JavaScript Objects- SOLO CHALLENGE](4_manipulating_js_objects)
5. [Design Your Own Code Combat Mission- SOLO CHALLENGE](5_design_cc_mission_solo_challenge)
6. [Group Project](6_group_project) **Check this out early!**
7. [Technical Blog](7_technical_blog.md)
8. [Cultural Blog](8_cultural_blog.md)
9. [GPS 1.2](9_gps1_2): **DO NOT READ UNTIL YOUR GPS SESSION!**

## Remember your Expectations for the Unit!
- Pair at least twice this week with a member of your accountability group.  *You need to pair 4 times on your own this unit*
- Give feedback for each person you paired with. *You need to submit at least 5 pieces of feedback in this unit*
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) on Socrates. *You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit*

## Submitting your work

You'll continue working in the `phase_0_unit_1` repository this week. Please note: You should have two separate repositories in your github account. You should have your [USERNAME].github.io and your phase_0_unit_1 repositories. Please keep these separate. Blog posts should always be included in your github.io repository, but all other challenges from here on out will go in your unit-specific repository. 

Please fetch the changes from DevBootcamp's master repo to get your week 3 curriculum. Use [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/fetching_changes.md) to fetch the changes (Try using the command line!)

You need to submit your work on the Unit 1, Week 3 submission form [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) by Sunday at 11:59pm. Expect to submit your links for each challenge above.
