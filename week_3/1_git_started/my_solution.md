## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
 This forces git to notice that you have a new file to commit to your repo.-->

#### branch
This is with regards to setting where you want the files to go. So setting a branch will allow you to create and push without affecting the master. -->

#### checkout
Checkout allows you to switch branches. ie changing between the master and a branch you created with branch-->

#### clone
This allows you to copy the branch to a new directory which can be helpful if you're looking to not affect the master or the folder of a given app. Can also be useful in the case of sharing. -->

#### commit
After you make all your changes, you'll want to commit, for git to take a snap of your progress and changes. After commiting the status will show all good. 

#### fetch
This pulls down any changes that others may have made to the repo. Or if it is a new repo, will download the data to your machine.
