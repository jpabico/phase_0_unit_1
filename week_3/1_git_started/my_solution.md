## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
 This forces git to notice that you have a new file to commit to your repo.-->

#### branch
This is with regards to setting where you want the files to go. So setting a branch will allow you to create and push without affecting the master. -->

#### checkout
Checkout allows you to switch branches. ie changing between the master and a branch you created with branch-->

#### clone
This allows you to copy the branch to a new directory which can be helpful if you're looking to not affect the master or the folder of a given app. Can also be useful in the case of sharing. -->

#### commit
After you make all your changes, you'll want to commit, for git to take a snap of your progress and changes. After commiting the status will show all good. 

#### fetch
This pulls down any changes that others may have made to the repo. Or if it is a new repo, will download the data to your machine. 

#### log
Log shows you how you have reached the commit you're currently at. So it shows you what changes have been made over different commits and by who. Essentially showing you the evolution to the current state.

#### merge
Merge will combine two branches by automatically figuring out a way to combine two different commits. This allows you to incorporate work you have completed on a branch back in to your master.

#### pull
Pull allows you to bring down any commits or changes that have been made to the master and incorporate them in to your commit. Pull is essentially a combination of fetch and merge. 

#### push
Push allows you to push your commit to a remote server. ie git push github master will update what you have in github to your most recent commit.

#### reset
As I understand it, rest is essentially an undo for a commit. So if you commit something and realize you were in the wrong branch, or accidentally made a change, you can undo it using reset. 

#### rm
RM for remove, removes the file from being tracked by git and also removes it from your directory. If you cache it, git will ignore, but it won't remove it from the dir. 

#### status
  This shows you not only the directory you're working in, but where you're at in terms of changes made and in terms of your most recent commit.
