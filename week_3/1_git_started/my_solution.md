## Release 5: Reflection


=======
## Release 5: Errors you encountered
1. Error
an error that I encountered was with syncing up with the github for my phase_0_unit_1 folder. 
2. Solution
My solution was to fork over the correct repo and merge my old folder with the new one.
3. Cause (explain the error)
the reason I had an error was because I had forked over an older copy of the repo, and I had two repos with the same name.
## Release 6: Reflection

Working on this challenge was fairly easy for me because we had already gone over using git and github during week 1. However, it was interesting and useful to define all the commands for git although I was already using most of them, I didnt know what much of the terminology in explanations for the commands meant until I completed this challenge. I felt that the biggest thing I learned was the difference between fetch and pull. Overall I enjoyed this challenge, and feel comfortable using it.
