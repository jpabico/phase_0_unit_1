# U1.W3: Code Combat's Beginner Campaign


## Learning Competencies
- Manipulate an object using JavaScript
- Explain what `()` does in JavaScript
- Use error messages correct syntax mistakes


## Release 0: Beginner Campaign
Visit [Code Combat](http://codecombat.com/play) and complete each of the missions in the beginner campaign using the steps below. These directions might seem tedious for something so simple, but it's important to get in the habit of going through these steps every time you work through a challenge.  

## Release 1: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/pseudocode.md)
Write the title of each mission (as a comment) in your [my_solution.js](./my_solution.js) file. 
 
Write simple pseudocode for each challenge. For example, write something like:

```javascript
// move right x2
// move up 1x
// ATTACK!
```  

## Release 2: Write your [Initial Solution](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/initial_solution.md)
Translate your pseudocode into code and see if it achieves your goals. If it doesn't quite work, modify it. Once you achieve each of the goals in each part, paste your successful code into your file. 

Repeat releases 1 and 2 for each mission.

## Release 3: Answer the following questions
When you are finished with all of the campaigns, answer the following questions. You may want to look at some resources on JavaScript before answering.
  - What is `this` referring to? Think programming-wise rather than in the terms of the game. 
  - What does the `()` do in JavaScript?
  - What is the point of the semicolons?

## Release 4: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/reflection_guidelines.md)
In the reflection section of your 'my_solution.js` file, reflect on your learning using the [reflection guidelines](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/reflection_guidelines.md). ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!***
