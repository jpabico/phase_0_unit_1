//I want a tool called 'sum' which can do the following:
// Take a list of numbers (the amount of numbers in the list can vary) and give me the sum of those numbers

//I want a tool called 'mean' which can do the following:
// Take a list of numbers (the amount of numbers in the list can vary) and give me the average of those numbers

//I want a tool called 'median' which can do the following:
// Take a list of numbers (the amount of numbers in the list can vary) and give me the sum of those numbers


// 1- define sum, whose property is an array of numbers
// sum each point in array
// print sum

// 2- define mean
// mean will come up with the mean of an array of numbers by summing all values and then dividing by number of values in the array
// print mean

// 3- define median
// median will come up wit the median of an array of numbers 
// median will split top half and bottom half, will then come up with median value
// print median
