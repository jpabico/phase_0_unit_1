// I have 2 lists of numbers that I want to use, one with an even length,
// and one with an odd length. the first set of numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7.
// the second set of numbers is 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7.
// I want to write something that will test multiple types of errors.
// if an error occurs I would like to know which error occured and what the error number is.
// the first thing I want to check for is something that has the role of adding things together.
// I want this role to be called sum.
//I want to test that the total of all the numbers of the odd set of numbers is 27
// I want to check that the even set of numbers adds up to 43
// I want a tool that can check for the average of both sets of numbers
// I want to make sure that the average of the odd set is 3.857142857142857
// I want to check that the average of the even set is 5.375
// the last tool I need is one that will find the median of both sets of numbers
// I want to check that the median of the odd set of numbers is 4
// I want to check thet the median of the even set of numbers is 5.5
